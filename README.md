# OBAgent

OBAgent is a monitor collection framework. OBAgent supplies pull and push mode data collection to meet different applications. By default, OBAgent supports these plugins: server data collection, OceanBase Database metrics collection, monitor data processing, and the HTTP service for Prometheus Protocol. To support data collection for other data sources, or customized data flow processes, you only need to develop plugins.
